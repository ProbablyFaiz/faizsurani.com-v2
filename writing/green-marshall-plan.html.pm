◊p{This paper was written by a five-person group in the Fall 2019 Climate Change Solutions class at UCSB. In addition to designing and typesetting the document in ◊Latex[], I authored Part 3: "A Green Marshall Plan," in which I outline a series of policy proposals to reduce emissions and promote U.S. climate leadership on the world stage through an ambitious foreign aid and green energy research plan.}

        <p>Hi, I’m Faiz (pronounced <span class="smallcaps">fez</span>). I’m currently a Research Fellow at <a href="https://reglab.stanford.edu">Stanford RegLab</a>, where my research focuses on AI governance and applications of natural language processing in the public sector. I graduated with High Honors from UC Santa Barbara in 2023 with a B.S. in Computing. Prior to RegLab, I worked in the software industry, including on the Neural Semantic Parsing team at Google.</p><p>In the field of computer science, my current interests include natural language processing, functional programming, and network science. Outside of CS, I’m also interested in a number of areas within public policy and constitutional law. You can find some of my work in these areas on this website.</p><p>One other thing dear to my heart: in college, I co-founded UCSB’s national championship-winning <a href="https://ucsbmootcourt.org">moot court team</a> and served as its president for three years. I remain involved in the moot court community; I co-founded the <a href="https://namcmootcourt.org">National Association of Moot Court</a>, a 501(c)3 nonprofit that operates a nationwide circuit of moot court tournaments for high school students.</p><p>If you have an interesting idea or good book recommendation, I’d love to <a href="mailto:faiz@faizsurani.com">hear from you.</a></p>

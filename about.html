        <p>Hi, I’m Faiz (pronounced <span class="smallcaps">fez</span>). I’m a Computing major in the <a href="https://ccs.ucsb.edu">College of Creative Studies</a> at UC Santa Barbara. I currently work as a research assistant at Stanford’s <a href="https://reglab.stanford.edu">RegLab</a> on a number of NLP efforts in the legal domain.</p><p>In the field of computer science, my current interests include network analysis, scalable systems, and natural language processing. Currently, I’m focused on <a href="/projects/lexcaliber">Lexcaliber</a>, a suite of network- and NLP-based recommendation and analyis algorithms to understand the law empirically. In that vein, I am an <a href="https://free.law/2022/03/17/summarizing-important-cases">active contributor</a> to the Free Law Project’s suite of open-source legal research tools. You can find more of my work scattered across this website and my <a href="https://github.com/ProbablyFaiz">GitHub</a> account.</p><p>Outside of computer science, I’m a dedicated effective altruist. Since 2020, I’ve been a member of and volunteer for <a href="https://givingwhatwecan.org">Giving What We Can</a>, for which I work on various writing and data science projects. I’m also passionate about public policy and constitutional law. My recent writing in these areas includes articles on <a href="https://dailynexus.com/2020-12-25/the-supreme-court-considers-reviving-state-sponsored-discrimination/">religious liberty</a>, <a href="/assets/parable-of-unix.pdf">copyright</a>, and <a href="/assets/affirmative-action.pdf">affirmative action</a> law. Additionally, I co-founded and led UCSB’s championship-winning <a href="https://ucsbmootcourt.org">undergraduate moot court team</a> and co-authored <a href="https://ucsbmootcourt.org/stockton-v-lsr"> a fictional moot court case problem</a> centered around the Free Exercise Clause and the Americans with Disabilities Act.</p><p>If you have an interesting opportunity or good book recommendation, I’d love to <a href="mailto:faiz@faizsurani.com">hear from you.</a></p>

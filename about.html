        <p>Hi, I’m Faiz (pronounced <span class="smallcaps">fez</span>). I’m a Computing major in the <a href="https://ccs.ucsb.edu">College of Creative Studies</a> at UC Santa Barbara. At the moment, I’m based in the Netherlands, where I’m studying abroad for the next several months.</p><p>In the field of computer science, my current interests include network analysis, scalable systems, and functional programming. Currently, I’m focused on <a href="/projects/lexcaliber">Lexcaliber</a>, a suite of network- and NLP-based recommendation and analyis algorithms to aid legal research. My other projects include <a href="/projects/drdocx">DrDocx,</a> <a href="https://github.com/project-anacapa/anacapa-github-linker">a computer science education research tool,</a> <a href="https://github.com/ProbablyFaiz/TABitha">an automated tabulation system for mock trial tournaments,</a> and <a href="https://faizsurani.com/assets/toll-of-substance-abuse.pdf">various</a> <a href="https://faizsurani.com/assets/gnp-evacuation-routes.pdf">data science</a> <a href="https://github.com/ProbablyFaiz/RedditPoliticalSentiment">projects</a> among other things.</p><p>Outside of computer science, I’m passionate about effective altruism, public policy, and constitutional law. Since 2020, I’ve been a member of and volunteer for <a href="https://givingwhatwecan.org">Giving What We Can</a>, for which I work on various writing and data science projects. I’m also passionate about public policy and constitutional law. My recent writing in these areas includes articles on <a href="https://dailynexus.com/2020-12-25/the-supreme-court-considers-reviving-state-sponsored-discrimination/">religious liberty</a>, <a href="/assets/parable-of-unix.pdf">copyright</a>, and <a href="/assets/affirmative-action.pdf">affirmative action</a> law. I also co-founded and currently lead UCSB’s <a href="https://ucsbmootcourt.org">undergraduate moot court team</a>, which has won back-to-back national championships in the <a href="https://amcamootcourt.org">American Moot Court Association’s</a> appellate brief competition.</p><p>This website is created with <a href="https://github.com/mbutterick/pollen">Pollen,</a> an open-source publishing system built in Racket. As much as I’m enjoying Racket, I can’t take credit for the incredible work done by Joel Dueck, whose <a href="https://github.com/otherjoel/try-pollen">try-pollen</a> project provides much of the code powering this website.</p><p>If you have an interesting opportunity or good book recommendation, I’d love to <a href="mailto:faiz@faizsurani.com">hear from you.</a></p>

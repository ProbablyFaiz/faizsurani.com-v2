Hi, I'm Faiz (pronounced FEZ). I'm currently a Computing major in the ◊hyperlink["https://ccs.ucsb.edu"]{College of Creative Studies} at UC Santa Barbara.

In the field of computer science, my current interests include scalable systems, human-centered design, and the Racket programming language. In addition to internships, my projects (past and present) include ◊hyperlink["https://DrDocx.com"]{DrDocx},◊numbered-note{DrDocx is a free, open source desktop application built to streamline medical practitioners workflows' with automated report generation and intelligent analysis.} ◊hyperlink["https://github.com/project-anacapa/anacapa-github-linker"]{a computer science education research tool}, ◊hyperlink["https://github.com/ProbablyFaiz/Mocktopia-Scripts"]{an automated tabulation system for mock trial tournaments}, and ◊hyperlink["project-assets/M3-Challenge-2019-Paper.pdf"]{various} ◊hyperlink["project-assets/GNP-Evacuation-Routes.pdf"]{data science} ◊hyperlink["https://github.com/ProbablyFaiz/RedditPoliticalSentiment"]{projects} among other things. For a full list, check out the homepage of this website.

Outside of computer science, I'm also passionate about public policy and constitutional law. My recent writing in these areas includes articles on ◊hyperlink["https://dailynexus.com"]{religious liberty} and ◊hyperlink["posts/deplatforming.html"]{antitrust} law. In addition, I've written academic analyses of ◊hyperlink["project-assets/climate-change-framework.pdf"]{climate-oriented foreign aid plans},  ◊hyperlink["project-assets/third-party-doctrine.pdf"]{Fourth Amendment jurisprudence} and the ◊hyperlink["project-assets/independent-legislature-doctrine.pdf"]{independent state legislature doctrine}. I also co-founded and lead UCSB's undergraduate moot court team, which qualified two teams to the ◊hyperlink["https://amcamootcourt.org"]{AMCA} national championship tournament this year.

This website is created with ◊hyperlink["https://github.com/mbutterick/pollen"]{Pollen}, an open-source publishing system built in Racket. As much as I'm enjoying Racket, I can't take credit for the incredible work done by Joel Dueck, whose ◊hyperlink["https://github.com/otherjoel/try-pollen"]{try-pollen} project provides the bulk of the code powering this website.

If you have an interesting opportunity or good book recommendation, I'd love to ◊hyperlink["mailto:faiz.surani@gmail.com"]{hear from you}.

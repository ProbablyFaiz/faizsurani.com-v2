Hi, I'm Faiz (pronounced ◊smallcaps{fez}). I'm currently a Computing major in the ◊hyperlink["ccs.ucsb.edu"]{College of Creative Studies} at UC Santa Barbara.

In the field of computer science, my current interests include scalable systems, human-centered design, and Racket

Outside of computer science, I'm also passionate about public policy and constitutional law. My recent writing in these areas includes articles on the religious liberty case 

This website is created with ◊hyperlink["https://github.com/mbutterick/pollen"]{Pollen}, an open-source publishing system built in Racket. As much as I'm enjoying playing around with Racket, I can't take credit for the incredible work done by Joel Dueck, whose ◊hyperlink["https://github.com/otherjoel/try-pollen"]{try-pollen} project provides the bulk of the code powering this website.

If you have an interesting opportunity or good book recommendation, I'd love to ◊hyperlink["mailto:faiz.surani@gmail.com"]{hear from you}.

◊(define-meta title            "About Me")

Hi, I'm Faiz (pronounced ◊smallcaps{fez}). I'm currently a Computing major in the ◊hyperlink["https://ccs.ucsb.edu"]{College of Creative Studies} at UC Santa Barbara.

In the field of computer science, my current interests include scalable systems, human-centered design, and ◊hyperlink["https://racket-lang.org/"]{Racket,} a Lisp dialect. In addition to internships, my projects (past and present) include ◊hyperlink["https://drdocx.com"]{DrDocx,} ◊hyperlink["https://github.com/project-anacapa/anacapa-github-linker"]{a computer science education research tool,} ◊hyperlink["https://github.com/ProbablyFaiz/Mocktopia-Scripts"]{an automated tabulation system for mock trial tournaments,} and ◊hyperlink["https://faizsurani.com/assets/toll-of-substance-abuse.pdf"]{various} ◊hyperlink["https://faizsurani.com/assets/gnp-evacuation-routes.pdf"]{data science} ◊hyperlink["https://github.com/ProbablyFaiz/RedditPoliticalSentiment"]{projects} among other things. For a full list, check out the homepage of this website.

Outside of computer science, I'm also passionate about public policy and constitutional law. My recent writing in these areas includes articles on ◊hyperlink["https://dailynexus.com"]{religious liberty} and ◊hyperlink["https://faizsurani.com/blog/deplatforming.html"]{antitrust} law. In addition, I've written academic analyses of ◊hyperlink["https://faizsurani.com/assets/climate-change-framework.pdf"]{climate-oriented foreign aid plans,}  ◊hyperlink["https://faizsurani.com/assets/third-party-doctrine.pdf"]{Fourth Amendment jurisprudence,} and ◊hyperlink["./assets/independent-legislature-doctrine.pdf"]{election law.} I also co-founded and lead UCSB's undergraduate moot court team, which qualified two teams to the ◊hyperlink["https://amcamootcourt.org"]{AMCA} national championship tournament this year.

This website is created with ◊hyperlink["https://github.com/mbutterick/pollen"]{Pollen,} an open-source publishing system built in Racket. As much as I'm enjoying Racket, I can't take credit for the incredible work done by Joel Dueck, whose ◊hyperlink["https://github.com/otherjoel/try-pollen"]{try-pollen} project provides much of the code powering this website. A blog post describing its fuller workings is in the works.

If you have an interesting opportunity or good book recommendation, I'd love to ◊hyperlink["mailto:faiz@faizsurani.com"]{hear from you.}

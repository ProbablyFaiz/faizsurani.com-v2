◊(define-meta title            "About Me")

Hi, I'm Faiz (pronounced ◊smallcaps{fez}). I'm a Computing major in the ◊hyperlink["https://ccs.ucsb.edu"]{College of Creative Studies} at UC Santa Barbara. I currently work as a Software Engineering Intern at Google on the Neural Semantic Parsing team. I'm also a research assistant at ◊hyperlink["https://reglab.stanford.edu"]{Stanford RegLab}, where I work on a number of NLP efforts in the legal domain.

In the field of computer science, my current interests include natural language processing, functional programming, and network science. Outside of CS, I'm also interested in a number of areas within public policy and constitutional law. You can find some of my work in these areas on this website.

If you have an interesting opportunity or a good book recommendation, I'd love to ◊hyperlink["mailto:faiz@faizsurani.com"]{hear from you.}

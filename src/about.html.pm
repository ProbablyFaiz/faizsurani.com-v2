◊(define-meta title            "About Me")

Hi, I'm Faiz (pronounced ◊smallcaps{fez}). I'm currently a Research Fellow at ◊hyperlink["https://reglab.stanford.edu"]{Stanford RegLab}, where my research focuses on AI governance and applications of natural language processing in the public sector. I graduated with High Honors from UC Santa Barbara in 2023 with a B.S. in Computing. Prior to RegLab, I worked in the software industry, including on the Neural Semantic Parsing team at Google.

In the field of computer science, my current interests include natural language processing, functional programming, and network science. Outside of CS, I'm also interested in a number of areas within public policy and constitutional law. You can find some of my work in these areas on this website.

One other thing dear to my heart: in college, I co-founded UCSB's national championship-winning ◊hyperlink["https://ucsbmootcourt.org"]{moot court team} and served as its president for three years. I remain involved in the moot court community; I co-founded the ◊hyperlink["https://namcmootcourt.org"]{National Association of Moot Court}, a 501(c)3 nonprofit that operates a nationwide circuit of moot court tournaments for high school students.

If you have an interesting idea or good book recommendation, I'd love to ◊hyperlink["mailto:faiz@faizsurani.com"]{hear from you.}

◊p{I led a five-person team that produced this paper over the course of 14 hours in response to ◊hyperlink["https://m3challenge.siam.org/archives/2019/problem"]{this prompt} for the 2019 M3 (Mathworks Math Modeling) Challenge. We created complex statistical models that predicted long-run trends of substance abuse in both teenagers and adults absent policy action and quantified the cost of substance abuse on society. Our paper was one of fewer than 15% of submitted papers to make it to the second round of judging.}

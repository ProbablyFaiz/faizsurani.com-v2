        <p>Hi, I’m Faiz (pronounced <span class="smallcaps">fez</span>). I’m currently a Computing major in the <a href="https://ccs.ucsb.edu">College of Creative Studies</a> at UC Santa Barbara.</p><p>In the field of computer science, my current interests include scalable systems, human-centered design, and the Racket programming language. In addition to internships, my projects (past and present) include <a href="https://DrDocx.com">DrDocx,</a><label for="-4320661019352659604" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="-4320661019352659604" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">DrDocx is a free, open source desktop application built to streamline medical practitioners workflows’ with automated report generation and intelligent analysis.</span> <a href="https://github.com/project-anacapa/anacapa-github-linker">a computer science education research tool,</a> <a href="https://github.com/ProbablyFaiz/Mocktopia-Scripts">an automated tabulation system for mock trial tournaments,</a> and <a href="project-assets/M3-Challenge-2019-Paper.pdf">various</a> <a href="project-assets/GNP-Evacuation-Routes.pdf">data science</a> <a href="https://github.com/ProbablyFaiz/RedditPoliticalSentiment">projects</a> among other things. For a full list, check out the homepage of this website.</p><p>Outside of computer science, I’m also passionate about public policy and constitutional law. My recent writing in these areas includes articles on <a href="https://dailynexus.com">religious liberty</a> and <a href="posts/deplatforming.html">antitrust</a> law. In addition, I’ve written academic analyses of <a href="project-assets/climate-change-framework.pdf">climate-oriented foreign aid plans,</a>  <a href="project-assets/third-party-doctrine.pdf">Fourth Amendment jurisprudence,</a> and the <a href="project-assets/independent-legislature-doctrine.pdf">independent state legislature doctrine</a>. I also co-founded and lead UCSB’s undergraduate moot court team, which qualified two teams to the <a href="https://amcamootcourt.org">AMCA</a> national championship tournament this year.</p><p>This website is created with <a href="https://github.com/mbutterick/pollen">Pollen,</a> an open-source publishing system built in Racket. As much as I’m enjoying Racket, I can’t take credit for the incredible work done by Joel Dueck, whose <a href="https://github.com/otherjoel/try-pollen">try-pollen</a> project provides the bulk of the code powering this website. A blog post describing its fuller workings is in the works.</p><p>If you have an interesting opportunity or good book recommendation, I’d love to <a href="mailto:faiz.surani@gmail.com">hear from you.</a></p>

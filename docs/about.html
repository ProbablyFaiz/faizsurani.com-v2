        <p>Hi, I’m Faiz (pronounced <span class="smallcaps">fez</span>). I’m currently a Computing major in the <a href="ccs.ucsb.edu">College of Creative Studies</a> at UC Santa Barbara.</p><p>In the field of computer science, my current interests include scalable systems, human-centered design, and Racket</p><p>Outside of computer science, I’m also passionate about public policy and constitutional law. My recent writing in these areas includes articles on the religious liberty case</p><p>This website is created with <a href="https://github.com/mbutterick/pollen">Pollen</a>, an open-source publishing system built in Racket. As much as I’m enjoying playing around with Racket, I can’t take credit for the incredible work done by Joel Dueck, whose <a href="https://github.com/otherjoel/try-pollen">try-pollen</a> project provides the bulk of the code powering this website.</p><p>If you have an interesting opportunity or good book recommendation, I’d love to <a href="mailto:faiz.surani@gmail.com">hear from you</a>.</p>

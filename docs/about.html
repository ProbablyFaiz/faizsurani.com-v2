        <p>Hi, I’m Faiz (pronounced <span class="smallcaps">fez</span>). I’m currently a Computing major in the <a href="https://ccs.ucsb.edu">College of Creative Studies</a> at UC Santa Barbara.</p><p>In the field of computer science, my current interests include scalable systems, human-centered design, and <a href="https://racket-lang.org/">Racket,</a> a Lisp dialect. In addition to internships, my projects (past and present) include <a href="https://drdocx.com">DrDocx,</a> <a href="https://github.com/project-anacapa/anacapa-github-linker">a computer science education research tool,</a> <a href="https://github.com/ProbablyFaiz/Mocktopia-Scripts">an automated tabulation system for mock trial tournaments,</a> and <a href="https://faizsurani.com/assets/toll-of-substance-abuse.pdf">various</a> <a href="https://faizsurani.com/assets/gnp-evacuation-routes.pdf">data science</a> <a href="https://github.com/ProbablyFaiz/RedditPoliticalSentiment">projects</a> among other things. For a full list, check out the homepage of this website.</p><p>Outside of computer science, I’m also passionate about public policy and constitutional law. My recent writing in these areas includes articles on <a href="https://dailynexus.com/2020-12-25/the-supreme-court-considers-reviving-state-sponsored-discrimination/">religious liberty</a> and <a href="https://faizsurani.com/blog/deplatforming.html">antitrust</a> law. In addition, I’ve written academic analyses of <a href="https://faizsurani.com/assets/climate-change-framework.pdf">climate-oriented foreign aid plans,</a>  <a href="https://faizsurani.com/assets/third-party-doctrine.pdf">Fourth Amendment jurisprudence,</a> and <a href="./assets/independent-legislature-doctrine.pdf">election law.</a> I also co-founded and lead UCSB’s undergraduate moot court team, which recently won a national championship in the <a href="https://amcamootcourt.org">AMCA</a> appellate brief competition.</p><p>This website is created with <a href="https://github.com/mbutterick/pollen">Pollen,</a> an open-source publishing system built in Racket. As much as I’m enjoying Racket, I can’t take credit for the incredible work done by Joel Dueck, whose <a href="https://github.com/otherjoel/try-pollen">try-pollen</a> project provides much of the code powering this website.</p><p>If you have an interesting opportunity or good book recommendation, I’d love to <a href="mailto:faiz@faizsurani.com">hear from you.</a></p>

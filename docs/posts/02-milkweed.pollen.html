◊margin-note{◊grey{◊newthought{Of the} two voices in this poem, the milkweed seems to have the better one: the sentiment is beautiful and the words have what you'd call a nice mouth-feel.  The stone's verse is ugly and awkward, maybe almost seeming like a simple case of bad writing. Whatever the verse's origin Wilbur chose to preserve this contrast. In ◊hyperlink["http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/s_z/wilbur/imageinterview.htm"]{an interview}, he said "the milkweed's speech is indeed written in one of my voices and was used for the sister's funeral in a genuine and appropriate way. But the other voice --- the 'slob' voice of the stone, is also one of my voices."}

◊verse[#:title "A Milkweed"]{
Anonymous as cherubs
Over the crib of God,
White seeds are floating
Out of my burst pod.
What power had I
Before I learned to yield?
Shatter me, great wind:
I shall possess the field.}

◊verse[#:title "A Stone"]{
As casual as cow-dung
Under the crib of God,
I lie where chance would have me,
Up to the ears in sod.
Why should I move? To move
Befits a light desire.
The sill of Heaven would founder
Did such as I aspire.}</div>

        <p class="pause-before"><span class="newthought">For a</span> novel about the return of English <a id="magic" class="index-entry">magic</a>, <em>Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell</em> is quite sparing with direct quotes from actual spells of magic. Only perhaps two or three such quotations are given in the entire 800-page book. Clarke’s ‘spells’ have a poetic form that is simple, sturdy, and elegant, in a way that avoids the kitsch and spook common to popular magical depictions (with their sing-song rhymes); and she makes use of a rich allusionary vocabulary that seems to stretch all through Western history and mythology.</p><p><label for="4333395294252177602" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="4333395294252177602" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote">From page 351 of the novel, where it is ostensibly quoted from Ormskirk’s <em>Revelations of Thirty-Six Other Worlds</em>.<br/><a id="celestial bodies" class="index-entry"></a><br/><a id="metal fasteners" class="index-entry"></a><br/><a id="desires" class="index-entry"></a></span></p><div class="poem"><pre class="verse" style="font-style: italic"><p class="poem-heading">Place the moon at his eyes</p><p>Place the moon at his eyes and her whiteness shall devour the false sights the deceiver has placed there.</p><p>Place a swarm of bees at his ears.

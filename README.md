# Faiz's Personal Website

Hi! This repository contains the source files for my website, [faizsurani.com](https://faizsurani.com).

This website is built with [Pollen](https://github.com/mbutterick/pollen), an open-source publishing system built in Racket, a Lisp dialect. Pollen is primarily for book publishing, but its incredible versatility makes it a great fit for this kind of website as well.
